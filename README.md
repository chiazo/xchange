# XChange

## Project Description
When entering college, students often struggle to adjust to a new environment while living on a budget. Given the pandemic and limited student interactions, students have had to rely heavily on a plethora of online platforms to exchange knowledge, items and tips. This disadvantages introverted students and those on a budget or operating within financial limitations as well as those struggling to juggle multiple digital sources of information. We are specifically targeting local UNC Chapel Hill students.

As a result, we are offering up a new web application, XChange, as a solution to connect the gaps in the current market. This app is meant to rival the likes of Facebook, Nextdoor, GroupMe, Reddit, Mercari and Yik Yak by creating a one stop shop for students to 1) connect, 2) buy and 3) exchange items with their peers. This differs from the aforementioned competitors because we are emphasizing privacy (Facebook), limiting our audience to one university, allowing for an organization of concerns (GroupMe), distinguishing between connecting and selling (Reddit/Mercari), removing shipping and delivery concerns (Mercari), and allowing for inclusivity by not prioritizing invitations to groups (Facebook/GroupMe).

Potential features include a trending page including pertinent deals and suggestions, a reddit style forum for people to discuss, reply and react to messages, a marketplace for buying/selling or exchanging, and text notifications for local events, time-sensitive activities, or 1 on 1 marketplace interactions.
